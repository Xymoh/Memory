JavaScript game, memory like game.

!! Currently game only in polish to be made in english in further development !!

We're giving a specific number of how many rows and how many columns do we want to have (rows: can be 2-20, columns: can be 2-30), also we need to specify how much time do we give for us to end the game.

After pressing the start button the game board shall generate with given player properties and the timer will start, it is now important to gather the maximum score before the time will end to success the game.

TO BE ADDED:
- english version
- sprites instead of "X" and numbers, with some static choice of sprites and their random choice
- logging system
- statistics
